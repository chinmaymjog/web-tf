# Shared Hosting Platform on Azure

![image](./docs/images/net_diag.png)

I've had the exciting opportunity to design and build a shared hosting platform on Azure.
The base requirement was to host websites built on a PHP CMS (e.g., WordPress) on a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack, while supporting multiple PHP versions.

In addition to these requirements, I focused on:

- Secured Architecture
- Network Load Balancing with SSL/TLS - Termination
- High Availability of Web Servers
- PaaS Solution for MySQL
- Code Repository & CI/CD
- Code Quality
- Platform Administration

## Sharing My Journey

I want to share my journey with the tech community. Through a series of posts, Iâ€™ll walk you through each phase of the project.
