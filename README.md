# Shared Hosting Platform on Azure

![image](./images/post_img.jpg)

I've had the exciting opportunity to design and build a shared hosting platform on Azure.
The base requirement was to host websites built on a PHP CMS (e.g., WordPress) on a LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) stack, while supporting multiple PHP versions.

In addition to these requirements, I focused on:

- Secured Architecture
- Network Load Balancing with SSL/TLS - Termination
- High Availability of Web Servers
- PaaS Solution for MySQL
- Code Repository & CI/CD
- Code Quality
- Platform Administration
